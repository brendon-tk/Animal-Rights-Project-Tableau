2. Animal cruelty policies
3. Regional animal welfare trends
4. Data Sources
We collected data from:

PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals)
World Animal Protection
Global Animal Law
Animal Rights Index
Tools & Technologies
Power BI / Tableau – for dashboard creation
Excel / SQL – for data preprocessing
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – for data analysis
PowerPoint – for final presentation

 Key Insights:
1 Some regions have weak policies on animal welfare.
2. High fur farming countries need awareness campaigns.
3 Educating consumers can influence ethical decisions.
